## act tasks

> "communication performs. actions express."
>
> communicative praxis and the spac of subjectivity. calvin o. schrag.

communicative acts imply realizable or unrealizable tasks.

### considering 

(consideration for future consequences)

1. [cfc]
2. [time preferences][timep]
3. [temporalism]
4. [educology] and [ learnability ][garson]
5. [ cooperative ethos ][roemer]

### identifying

(identification of future consequeces)

1. modal spotlight theory; moving spotlight theory, by brad skow. (y'know,
   but with [modalism]).
2. [role]
3. [The Language of Philosophy and the Philosophy of Language: a Symbiotic Paradigm][asp]
4. [fourthness]
5. [typicality]

### recognizing 

(recognition for future consequences)

1. non-classical systematicity
2. metonymic structure; [metonymies] are more literal than
   metaphors. 

### attending

(attention for future consequences)

1. see [metaphors] for [attention], by mark johnson and george lakoff.
2. criteriological occurrence and consciousness, p.m.s. hacker and bennett
3. occasion as “prehension” (comprehensibility), “objective data”
   (specializability), “present satisfaction” (satisfiability),
   “concrescence” (concretizability)

![THE RELEVANCE OF WITTGENSTEIN’S PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOLOGY TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES P. M. S. Hacker \ Clarification of the psychological concepts that are deployed in psychological investigations is a prerequisite for posing fruitful questions amenable to experimental methods. \ This has direct bearing on the psychological sciences. In particular, it can serve to rule out a range of psychological theories that fail to respect this conceptual scheme, while simultaneously invoking it. Wittgenstein’s philosophy of psychology provides a firm ground for fundamental criticisms of: \ Psychological predicates typically display first/third-person asymmetry. The characteristic first-person present tense use (an Aüsserung or avowal) does not rest on introspection conceived as inner sense; nor does it rest on observation of one’s own behaviour. It is groundless. The third-person use, by contrast, rests on what the subject says and does. \ (vii) ‘First-person (epistemic) authority’ and ‘privileged access’ are misnomers. In saying ‘I have a headache’, the speaker enjoys no authority regarding an object of knowledge about which he is better informed than others. \ If anything, the speaker enjoys a form of verdictive power to decide, as when he says ‘I want a glass of water’. If a person cannot say what he wants, what he has to do is not find out, but examine the desirability characteristics of the options and decide what to want. \ To ascribe psychological attributes to the brain is to commit a mereological fallacy – akin to claiming that it is aeroplane’s engines, rather than aeroplanes, that fly, or that it is the great wheel of a clock, rather than the clock as a whole, that keeps time.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nerdfiles/communicative-praxis/master/witty.png)
