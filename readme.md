## act tasks

> "communication performs. actions express."

communicative acts imply realizable or unrealizable tasks.

### conceivability

#### demandingness

#### desirability

#### warrantability

#### projectability

projectable predicates, etc.

#### (multiple) realizability

#### exemplification

#### inferential expressivity

sentences bear subjects of multiple modalities, fundamentally in no
particular arrangement or architecture between themselves. *aboutness* itself
is an acentered conjecture of something about something. sentences reveal
subjects as agents or topics, or form in general that is structured. minimally
a well-formed sentence may express one subject, namely of which whom or what
acts on an object or through an object given. at once the sentence could
relate a topic as-subject or as-structure according to its ensembling in action.

at one level a sentence relates one thing, some agent, say. at another it relates,
perhaps, a truth-apt claim about something. are sentences always and everywhere
about this business? sometimes they are. for whom the sentence is about is
again here at once a question that underscores a manner of acontextuality;
how does one become acontextual in such a way as we relate between sentences
as do their speakers ex hypothesis? can we merely grant that we are composing
anything from the structure of the space of possibility? contexts are structured,
but structure itself, obviously, is not (just) another context.

  (a) this is not (just) a structure.

[compare][dark]:

  (b) this is not (just) a pattern [of the space of possibility]

what's workable for this analysis?

```
L1* Lying is a sign.
P1* If [lying is wrong], then [to teach your little brother to lie is wrong].
P2* [Lying is wrong].
————————————————————————————–
C* [To teach your little brother to lie is wrong].
```

a point here is to draw out models or semantics for assemblages in medium specificity.
*labeling* begets learnability. suppose `L1* Lying is a sign.` now here asserted
attitudinal disposition is presupposed, but only with arrangement and activity;
however *mere assertion*, *mere arrangement*, and *mere supposition of activity*
(i.e., conceivability) confers not a model that is an analogy with the *agency 
of reasons* (talk of *projectability*, *desirability*) or *advantage of
proposition* (*warrantability*; i.e., warrant to infer; median utility,
probabilitistic contents), which are matters having to concern the structure
of *credences* and *fitness* of belief (*assentability* not to be confused
with *aptness*).

"labeling" is not so much a confession to annotate with abandon
(proliferation of metadata signifiers) but to elaborate the structure of
circumstance as a condition of the model, for, and between peerless,
autonomous tasks in eventual interactivity or joint epistemic sponteneity.

#### is this not just "going modal"?

yes and no. we could see modalism as a gesture toward some realism about
something or other. it is *really true* that we want to outline who disagrees
and who does not, but that's not only it. traceability, adjustability,
and incrementability of belief or desire play roles as descriptive
indicators of the motion that is disagreement. spatiotemporal description
leaves us wanting for what follows logically from disagreement. modality
tells us when there is a change in the quality properties of meaningful truth
(or say, contribution thereto its realization). that a sign may change
is a constant reality of the measure of disagreement, how near or far those
in disagreement or agreement relate to one another given some other
existing notional stability of attendant or co-governing sense. modes
for graph traversal, often represented as conceivability, become undone 
given radical change or difference of advantage of proposition between
agents.

typically speakers do not speak as though certain objects would not exemplify
properties; their speech is not a stipulaion that quality properties do not
hold but rather should. obviously we presume to some extent a likeness of
ourselves to those who would exemplify qualities coherent with our descriptions.
to say the least, if it is true that lying is wrong, we do not as speakers
typically seek to point that out about ourselves merely in virtue of a sentence
possessing certain qualities by other speakers arrangements, assertions, or
active uses (in a discourse). we may call ourselves liars but that's got
very little to do with `lying is wrong` appearing in an argument somewhere
because it happens to be a premise. more important, it demands that exemplification
be a quality property of arguments which, so then, presupposees the existence
of labels for those whom or what exemplify in nature according to the arguments.
not just anyone exemplifies that lying is wrong when so considered, for there
is no fact of the matter to answer such a question while as yet, that's not
whom speakers are intending to search out as-if lurking around in their own
meaning.

  <img alt="THE RELEVANCE OF WITTGENSTEIN’S PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOLOGY TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES P. M. S. Hacker \ Clarification of the psychological concepts that are deployed in psychological investigations is a prerequisite for posing fruitful questions amenable to experimental methods. \ This has direct bearing on the psychological sciences. In particular, it can serve to rule out a range of psychological theories that fail to respect this conceptual scheme, while simultaneously invoking it. Wittgenstein’s philosophy of psychology provides a firm ground for fundamental criticisms of: \ Psychological predicates typically display first/third-person asymmetry. The characteristic first-person present tense use (an Aüsserung or avowal) does not rest on introspection conceived as inner sense; nor does it rest on observation of one’s own behaviour. It is groundless. The third-person use, by contrast, rests on what the subject says and does. \ (vii) ‘First-person (epistemic) authority’ and ‘privileged access’ are misnomers. In saying ‘I have a headache’, the speaker enjoys no authority regarding an object of knowledge about which he is better informed than others. \ If anything, the speaker enjoys a form of verdictive power to decide, as when he says ‘I want a glass of water’. If a person cannot say what he wants, what he has to do is not find out, but examine the desirability characteristics of the options and decide what to want. \ To ascribe psychological attributes to the brain is to commit a mereological fallacy – akin to claiming that it is aeroplane’s engines, rather than aeroplanes, that fly, or that it is the great wheel of a clock, rather than the clock as a whole, that keeps time."
