![THE RELEVANCE OF WITTGENSTEIN’S PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOLOGY TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES P. M. S. Hacker

Clarification of the psychological concepts that are deployed in psychological investigations is a prerequisite for posing fruitful questions amenable to experimental methods.

This has direct bearing on the psychological sciences. In particular, it can serve to rule out a range of psychological theories that fail to respect this conceptual scheme, while simultaneously invoking it. Wittgenstein’s philosophy of psychology provides a firm ground for fundamental criticisms of:

Psychological predicates typically display first/third-person asymmetry. The characteristic first-person present tense use (an Aüsserung or avowal) does not rest on introspection conceived as inner sense; nor does it rest on observation of one’s own behaviour. It is groundless. The third-person use, by contrast, rests on what the subject says and does.

(vii) ‘First-person (epistemic) authority’ and ‘privileged access’ are misnomers. In saying ‘I have a headache’, the speaker enjoys no authority regarding an object of knowledge about which he is better informed than others.

If anything, the speaker enjoys a form of verdictive power to decide, as when he says ‘I want a glass of water’. If a person cannot say what he wants, what he has to do is not find out, but examine the desirability characteristics of the options and decide what to want.

To ascribe psychological attributes to the brain is to commit a mereological fallacy – akin to claiming that it is aeroplane’s engines, rather than aeroplanes, that fly, or that it is the great wheel of a clock, rather than the clock as a whole, that keeps time.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nerdfiles/communicative-praxis/master/witty.png)
